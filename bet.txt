Im going to write as many lines of code into this webapp as soon as I can.
Figure out the architecture this web app needs using draw.io.
Sit down with Caleb and construct a good plan to get the server running to start development.

Steps:

- purchase domain name
- plot development in Azure using draw.io
- sanitize git repo (keys, files)
- start azure webapp layout (under caleb's info for $200 cred)
- create kanban board for future steps and make cards for them

- design basic landing page with wip information
- install docker containers for webapp, and kibana
- look for context art for grow.io (later commission)
- begin networking webapp for security and workflow (link domain name)
- configure firewall to filter unwanted content from backend
- create load balancer for site traffic
- use playbooks to populate webapp environments
- research databases to use for python rnd
- begin writing front end for webapp and design site layout
- possibly outsource design concepts to be polished
- begin writing back end user account functionality, bookmarking, and builds tool
- find out what resellers offer the equipment and which would be prioritized
- start implementing apis for resellers (redirect payments)
- sanitize code, pentest site, and load test
- research google adsense costs
- research and impliment SEO concepts
- create budget plan and calculate possible cost/revinue
- determine ownership agreement
- purchase name licensing contract
